# Project SAKSHAM2.O
# AI based Firewall with ML integration for threat intelligence

## Overview
Saksham is an Ai based firewall for manitoring data packets to detect milicious activity upon a system using
Artificial intelligence and machine learning models to overcome the latest threats and attacks.
## Features
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Threat Detection and instrution Prevention**
- üîç **Machine learning model integration**
- ü§ñ **AI-powered response using Logistic Regression Model**
- ‚ö° **Efficient Log management in database**
- üîí **Defending against the AI generated attacks**

## Marketing
- We are looking to introduce our product to different organizations to help them to withstand against the attacks and threats in respective of minimal charges for it.
- Users and organizations can visit our website to contact us to buys our services.

### Terminology
-The firewall monitors the network packets for the milicious data in it using the AIML based models like Logistic Regression Model which s a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes (like yes/no, true/false). 
-It works by modeling the relationship between input features and the probability of a certain outcome using a logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function.
-When the Hacker will attack on a particular system , our firewall will scan all the network packets for the malicious data based on upon the TCP, Header and Tailler of packets,Port,Payloads and packet behaviour.
-Based on the machine learning model the firewall will analyze the packet configuration for the malicious data packets , if packets found the firewall will block the data packets and respective IP address
and update the details regarding in the ML model for further classification.
